## The Diamond Chase
*(insert deep lore)*


A challenge awakens in the Shadow Maze of our University.
The Evil Teacher grants freedom to any student that gets the self manipulated Diamond first, loser stays on the maze for an eternity.

`(You) Mpampis Poteridis` and thy best friend  `Malphoes Loukas`  accept the challenge.
